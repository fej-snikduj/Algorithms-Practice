// nthFibonacci
// Suppose a newly-born pair of iguanas, one male, one female, are put in a large aquarium.

// Iguanas are able to mate at the age of one month so that at the end of its second month a female can produce another pair of iguanas.

// Suppose that our iguanas never die and that the female always produces one new pair (one male, one female) every month from the second month on.

// How many pairs of iguanas will there be after n months?

// For example, the iguana pair size for months zero through five are:

// 0 1 1 2 3 5
// If n were 4, your function should return 3; for 5, it should return 5.

// HINT: This iguana pattern is described exactly by the fibonacci sequence:

// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number

// Write a function that accepts a number n and returns the number of iguana pairs after n months.

// DO NOT use a recursive solution to this problem. Your solution must run in linear time.

// Note: Your solution may fail if you have a comment in your nthFibonacci function that contains the string literal “nthFibonacci” somewhere within it.
